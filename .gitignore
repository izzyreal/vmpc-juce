# Some typical directories for CMake configurations

build/
Debug/
Release/

# A convention I have for CMake configuration and
# builds that are specific to iOS. iOS configs
# and builds use a different toolchain, hence a
# different config and build directory.
build-ios/

# Default directories where CLion stores CMake
# configurations and builds.
cmake-build-debug/
cmake-build-release/

# 'editables' are downloaded repositories that I
# maintain or fork; i.e. I want to be able to edit
# them often or sometimes.
editables/

# 'deps' are downloaded repositories that I don't
# maintain or fork. So far, I have never made any
# changes to them; not ones that I wanted to persist
# in any case.

# JetBrains CLion generates this directory whenever
# you open a project. I recommend not to version it.
.idea/

# Generated by CMakeLists.txt
src/main/version.h

# Symlink generated by CMakeLists.txt, hence we
# don't version this. Note that whenever a source
# file is removed, added, or renamed in the project,
# this file should be regenerated by running cmake,
# if you want accurate LSP functionality.
# This file can be used by YouCompleteMe, and
# probably other LSP clients too.
